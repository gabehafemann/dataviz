# Critiquing Redfin Data by Redesign


## Step one: the visualization

For the critique by design project, I chose to look at housing affordability data from Redfin. Before I came back to school, I worked in housing policy and food security advocacy, advocating for things like SNAP funding expansion and the introduction of state- and federal-level Renter Tax Credits. I opted for a dataset I already had a connection to. Specifically, I chose to redesign the mortgage affordability data visualization because it's conveying really staggering information: that people need to be making more than $100,000 annually to reasonably afford the national median mortgage. That's even assuming, either generously or naively, that people can scrape together a 20% down payment despite the skyrocketing costs.

I'm looking at this graph from Redfin

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- text is confusing; then it makes more sense in context
- Simpler way to sum up what's going on

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
surprising that the lines never touch
-include 30% threshold
-income needed to comfortably afford
-rent burdened
-add one more year as a benchmark
-be more journalistic about the title 'income required to buy a house grossly more than median'


- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- homebuyers by 


- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

General responses:

-include another couple of ways to index the dates on the graph
-clean up the title and labels such that it's more intelligble period -- leverage subtitles to clarify the 30% threshold rather than putting it in the label
-maybe include a trendline for the median mortgage payment? might be distracting because the scale is so much lower
-keep the shading between the income where median mortgage doesn't exceed 30% of income and actual median income, maybe include a parenthetical/bracket or arrow situation
-change top line label to "income where median mortgage is affordable"
-"income required to afford median mortgage"


## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
