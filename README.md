# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University! I'll be updating it over the course of the semester with visualizations I develop for my classes about GIS, visual storytelling, and Tableau. I'm excited to be honing these skills! 

# About me
Hey y'all, my name's Gabe (they/them). I'm a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon with a passion for making sure policy makes sense to people. That means telling clear stories about why our systems are the way they are, de-jargonifying social programs, and searching for opportunities to bring people into the processes of decisionmaking at all levels.

In life outside the cloud, I love reading (give me reccs, please, especially if it's your favorite author from your hometown), movies, getting outside (I'm training for a thru hike!), bicycling, and oogling people's dogs (especially tiny ones, especially in sweaters).

I'm passionate about urbanism and closing rural-urban divides, labor policy, conservation, public transportation, and our food system. Let's talk!




# What I hope to learn

So many things! But to look at some broad strokes:

1. Design best practices (some foundational color theory, visual hierarchy, and so on)
2. A variety of softwares for producing graphs, charts, etc. such that I can succeed in the varied resource landscapes of future employers
3. Elements of style and how to cultivate a unique (but professionally managed) visual grammar
