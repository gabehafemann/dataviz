# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  I'll be updating it over the course of the semester with visualizations I develop for my classes about GIS, visual storytelling, and Tableau. I'm excited to be honing these skills! 

# About me
Hey y'all, my name's Gabe (they/them). I'm a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon with a passion for making sure people can understand policy. That means telling clear stories about why our systems are the way they are, de-jargonifying social programs, and searching for opportunities to bring people into the processes of decisionmaking at all levels.

In life outside the cloud, I love reading (give me reccs, especially if it's your favorite author from your hometown), movies, getting outside, bicycling, and oogling people's dogs (especially tiny ones, especially in sweaters).

I'm passionate about urbanism and closing the rural-urban divides, labor policy, public transportation, and our food system. Let's talk!


# What I hope to learn

So many things! But to look at some broad strokes:

1. Design best practices (some foundational color theory, visual hierarchy, and so on)
2. A variety of softwares for producing graphs, charts, etc. such that I can succeed in the varied resource landscapes of future employers
3. Elements of style and how to cultivate a unique (but professionally managed) visual grammar

## Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Editing Reference Information

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
