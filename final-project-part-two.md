# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience is folks with little experience with public transit or people who care about it and want to learn more about how to get involved.
To reach representative individuals, I'm going to ask classmates around Heinz (who admittedly represent a narrow swathe of people nationwide and educated in a super sample-biasing way). For my purposes, it's convenient to me that people come from geographically all over (small towns to megacities) and have a variety of degrees of experience with transit. They also have a lower barrier to persuasion because their CMU cards cover fares.


## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

My overall goal is to make transit feel approachable, but also to paint the picture that trends are changing.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Get an emotional barometer re transit & the story     |  How does this make you feel?   |
| Understand how to make the narrative more effective |  What would make it easier for you to connect to the subject? |
| Identify opportunities to tweak graphs to be more precise | What elements of the visuals aren't working? |

Getting perspectives from people who are less transit-nerd-inside-baseball about it is going to be instrumental in this series of vizzes actually being helpful.


## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 (classmate, MSPPM) | Interview 2 (classmate, MAM) | Interview 3 (MISM) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What feeling does the story evoke? | It feels cozy  | It's cute but jumps too much between emotions -- need more transition space before bad news  | "Neutral-positive" |
|  What would make it easier for you to connect to the subject?   |  Establish a clearer sense of place -- maps are good but it could use a photo of the town for a more specific feel | Use approachable colors rather than just white | "Maybe add a photo of a cool view from the inside of a [PRT] bus" |
|  What elements of the visuals aren't working? | The maps are good but the scroll is clunky -- have subsequently edited to hopefully make it smoother | Balance the white space; make the images take up more room because they're where so much of the work is | Titles are too small/text unhelpful - edit it |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  The graphs don't tell a complete story regarding how transit is changing separately from cars | I plan on adding in a graph with FHA data I found regarding the increase in car usership for the past seven decades |
|   |                                                    |
| Headings on existing graphs are too small, weirdly worded               |   I plan on changing titles/styles to be more narratively effective     |
|  Cut down on the personal story to make more room for the quant/vizualization     |   I plan on adding another couple of charts regarding prevalence of different kinds of charts over time using RawGraphs. I think the bumpgraph/streamgraph could be a really cool way to visualize that without straying too far from the main beats    |
|             |                                                                                 |


I plan on beefing up content, too, for a quick "learn more here!" section including fare structures for PRT and a link to the Transit app to check when bus times. The goal is to establish a toolkit at the end that reduce barriers to usership in an approachable way.

Further, I think I'm going to try to find some information about some of the costs of car ownership if it doesn't feel like it will overcomplicate the narrative. I need to fiddle with it and see what works.
