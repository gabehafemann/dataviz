# The final data story
> Include a link to your final data story on Shorthand, Esri StoryMaps, etc. here. 

Here's a link to my final Shorthand project:
[Talkin' Transit](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/transit-project/index.html)


# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

Since the completion of Part II, I've gone through and made a variety of changes. To address feedback from my peers, I added a greater variety of visualizations and included more photographs (courtesy of Unsplash) to add to the cozy, personal dimension of the narrative. 

I also updated the original dataviz to include larger titles for greater readability. It wasn't playing well on either small or large screens (especially, perhaps, during my presentation) so I wanted to update that.

My colleagues also suggested that the draft they saw lost the plot some, so I cut it down to main beats and added a more specific call to action. Rather than just encouraging people to think of themselves as transit users, I figured it'd be better to encourage them to take the first step -- use the system at all at least once.



## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

I'm on a lifelong campaign to turn people into public transit people, so I figured I should start where I have the most persuasive power and the broadest swathe of people with potentially little experience and basically no barrier to entry -- my peers! Ultimately, the audience is CMU students with an active transit pass.


## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

Design decisions -- I wanted to keep it a little light and airy. One thing I noticed in some other presentations is that the backgrounds were rich and visually interesting, sure, but often didn't let their content breathe. I deliberately opted for a plain style to balance visual engagement and focus on the narrative.

I thought about including a bit more (a zoom map made it into one draft of this project) about my personal background with transit, and the dozenish cities I've lived in. In that draft, I had a scroll zoom map of all my moves (La Crosse, WI -> Eau Claire, WI -> Oakland, CA -> Eau Claire again -> Minneapolis, MN -> Wyoming, WI (pop. 87, just 87) -> Minneapolis, MN -> Boston, MA -> Washington, DC -> Minneapolis -> Newport, VT (pop. 4000, wild transportation situation) -> MN -> Pittsburgh. But for the scope of this class and the narrative, that felt excessively self-indulgent and counterproductive to being meaningfully persuasive. My goal is to demonstrate that I know a thing or two about a transit system that works, not to tell my life story. But ultimately, while I spent a bunch of time on that, it didn't serve the end goal and laid to rest on the cutting room floor. It's more spare than I'd like, but I do like that it has breathing room.

## References
> **You should have already included detailed references on your Shorthand story** - if so, you do not need to list them twice, unless you used additional references for specific to your writeup. Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary. If there is additional information for your shorthand readers that you've placed on this page, link from Shorthand to this page. Make sure to double-check that you aren't using copyright material and that you have added / updated any citations or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.

## AI acknowledgements
> If you used AI to help you complete this assignment (within the parameters of the instruction and course guidelines), detail your use of AI for this assignment here.

I didn't use AI in the production of any of my Data Viz homework or final project.


# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section. 

I ran out of time to really deep dive other avenues for storytelling. Shorthand was buggy and I spent like 30% of my project time trying to get it not to lag. I think if I had more time (and honestly more patience), I could have built a more visually rich story.
